# NAVIS

This project aims to create a semi-accurate (read "look like real but isn't") boat simulation.
The project is split into various modules aimed at delivering various aspects of the game. Since everything is cut into modules you can use some of this code to add floating things to your game.

## MODULES
### NAVIS
This is the base module, it will provide classes requiered everywhere, so not much actually.

### NAVIS_Physics
This modules implements mostly functions to represent forces calculation. 

### More to come...
It is my desire to implement :
- Destruction
- Projectiles
- Sea deformations
- Island generation
- Arcade controls

## How Can I use it
You just need an Unreal Engine either from Epic's source code, or from EpicGames Launcher.

## How can I help ?
You can pull request, IÂ´ll review them and will probably merge them.
